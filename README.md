# myAwesomeRepository
BY far one of the best repositories


Assignements:

 1. Create your own public git repo on GitHub.
  - Add files
  - Modify a file
  - Delete a file
  - Create a feature branch
  - Modify a file
  - Merge back the branch


2. In groups of 2-3 people:
  - For each of your own public git repos on GitHub.
  - Owner creates a feature branch / the others each create a fork.
  - ... change a file
  - ... modify the same file so that you have to resolve a merge conflict later on
  - ... create a pull request
  - ... add the others to the group as reviewers. 
  (does this work? if not, what do you have to do to make it work)?
  - each reviewer comments on the change 
  - Merge the pull request
